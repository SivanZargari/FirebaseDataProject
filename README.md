# Retrieving, Inserting, Editing, and Deleting Data into Firebase Database via UI

This project demonstrates how to retrieve data manually entered into a Firebase Firestore database using React, as well as how to insert, edit, and delete data through the UI, with changes being reflected both in the UI and the Firebase database.

## Technologies Used:

- Firebase (Firestore)
- React
- Node.js

## Overview:
This application fetches data from a Firestore database and displays it in a React app. The data is stored in a Firebase Firestore database and can be accessed by making HTTP requests to the backend server (Node.js). Additionally, the app allows users to insert new data through the UI, which is then stored in Firebase and displayed in a well-organized table. Users can also edit and delete existing data, and these changes are immediately reflected in both the UI and the Firebase database.
