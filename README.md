# Retrieving and Inserting Data into Firebase Database via UI

This project demonstrates how to retrieve data manually entered into a Firebase Firestore database using React, as well as how to insert new data through the UI and display it in a table format.

## Technologies Used:

- Firebase (Firestore)
- React
- Node.js

## Overview:
This application fetches data from a Firestore database and displays it in a React app. The data is stored in a Firebase Firestore database and can be accessed by making HTTP requests to the backend server (Node.js). Additionally, the app allows users to insert new data  through the UI, which is then stored in Firebase and displayed in a well-organized table.
